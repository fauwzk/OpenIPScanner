# OpenIPScanner / NeTools

A work in progress *ip scanner* and *ports tester* written in python. 
It's a test for a library I want to release in the future called *NeTools* which (I want) to be multi-platform and **quite** high level and simple to use. For now the "library" is included in this project as a test. 

## Usage

### On windows:
```bash
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
> python3 main.py
```
### On Linux/Unix:
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo python3 main.py
```
