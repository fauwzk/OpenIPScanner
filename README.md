# OpenIPScanner / NeTools

A work in progress *ip scanner* and *ports tester* written in python. 
It's a test for a library I want to release in the future called *NeTools* which (I want) to be multi-platform and **quite** high level to be simple to use. Now the "library" is included in this project as a test.
